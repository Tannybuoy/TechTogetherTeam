# Sincerely, Your Penpal
Pen pal matching & communication app (we will be matching users to their pen pal based on the interests they indicated, and use ML to determine the personality of the user based on their Twitter tweets). Once matched, pen pals have the ability to create customized letters and upload videos to send each other (with a delay in time, as based on their real-life locations)

## Inspiration


## What it does
With a machine Learning model using a Kaggle dataset to predict the personality type of a person.

## How we built it
The Machine learning model was built using the scikit learn library available in python. The model was then stored using joblib. Data was collected from a user through a website whose backend was supported in flask.
